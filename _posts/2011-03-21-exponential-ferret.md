Last night one of the ferrets just stood idly on the floor for about half a minute just staring blankly at me. It looked a bit like she was really concentrating, so the first hypothesis to explain this behavior was that she was trying to create a copy of herself through agamogenesis (asexual reproduction). This naturally led to the notion of a ferret able to duplicate itself once every minute, and seeing that playing with exponential growth is always fun, this scenario deserves some illustrations:

#### 0 minutes

A single ferret, concentrating extremely hard.

#### 1 minute
