I'm currently running the popular Wolves of Welton D&D one-shot, and I've made some updates to it, mainly redoing the maps locations there and I plan to add further locations in the future to support more exploration and more quests in the area to increase the adventure play time up from a 1-2 sessions to about 5-6 sessions.

**NOTE: This is currently a work in progress**
