I used to have a blog back in the days. Using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) to host my own site, custom theme and plugins and all sorts of nifty stuff. Sadly most of the content is long lost (I might have a look and see if I have a backup export somewhere, if no there is always the [WayBack machine](http://web.archive.org/) which I might use to recover a post or two.

And after a 5 year break I feel it's time to start blogging again, mostly it will probably be infrequent stuff about software development, game development and maybe even a few arduino projects.

After looking at solutions like Wordpress and Tumblr, I decided to go with something simpler and less userfriendly and ended up with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is pretty damn awesome as it uses git, github and markdown to power the website. This means I can edit everything as I would any project using git, and just push it to github to update the blog. Getting it to work was a breeze (mainly just forking <https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io> and started editing)

I also always have full controll of the data, and since the blog lives on github and my github account is [always mirrored locally](https://gist.github.com/erlendaakre/698bc6756ba0028fa7b7) I won't have to worry about backups
