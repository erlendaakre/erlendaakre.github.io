I set up a new VPS server last night with Debian + mysql + lighttpd to host all my php stuff (which so far has been on a shared hosting server, which is horrible).

Now this wordpress is running on the new server (Serenity) and it’s alot faster, and I’ll be moving 4-5 other wordpress installs over to this new server in the next couple of days.

That way I can do complete wordpress backups automatically for all wordpress installations and a full mysql dump automatically :)
