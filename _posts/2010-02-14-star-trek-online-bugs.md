So, beta is over, and I’ve made it to Commander level (not had much time to play). So far the game is pretty fun, but I’ll reserve judgment until I’ve hit endgame.

So meanwhile I’ll post my two favorite bugs from the beta

#### Ground avatar in space instead of spaceship

#### and of course.. The eyes popping out while doing the dance emote
