I love google analytics (a way to know home many people visit your website, what they searched for, where they come from, etc..), it’s great and awesome in all sorts of ways that I won’t go into right now, instead allow me to present some funny search queries that have all somehow led people to this blog.

variations of *“stargate universe sucks”* - **1100 hits**
variations of *“new star trek movie sucks”* – **1800 hits**

=== Big tits! ===
So far so good, at least there are a few people out there with good taste, but it is when you get down to the more unique searches, those with only a few hits that you find the weird stuff.. Apparently even tough Stargate Universe sucks, somebody on the show has huge (or big) tits :D

* *Stargate universe big tits* - **13**
* *stargate universe girl with big tits* - **6**
* *“stargate universe” “big tits”* - **2**
* *big tits on sgu* - **2**
* *big tits stargate universe* -**3**
* *girl with big tits on stargate universe* - **1**
* *actress with the huge tits on stargate universe* - **1**
* *who is the girl with the big tits on stargate universe?* - **1**
* *biggest tits on stargate universe* - **1**
* *chick with huge tits on stargate universe* - **1**
* *sgu stargate universe big tits* - **1**
* *star gate universe big tits* - **1**
* *stargate universe huge tits* - **1**
* *sgu kills off big tits?* - **1**
* *stargate universe chick with huge tits* - **1**
* *stargate universe chick with big tits* - **5**

After some research, I can only assume they are looking for pictures of Julia Benson:

I just realized that due to it’s questionable content, this post will undoubtedly attract more hits from people with nothing better to do than googling for Julia Bensons boobs, so I might just as well throw in another picture, I’d hate for people to leave empty handed.

=== Some other weird searches with only 1 hit ===

***why do the shields on the enterprise suck?***  
I have no idea, the real question is why would somebody write that phrase in a search engine?

***mexican knick knacks***  
I'm sorry this visitor didn't find what he/she was looking for on this blog :(

***why are everyone in stargate universe morons?***  
I… Don’t… Know…
