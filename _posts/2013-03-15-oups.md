While cleaning up in the core classes of Trekwar yesterday (documenting functions, formatting/structuring code, minor improvements) I also saw lots of equals(Object o) methods. And in my infinite wisdom I decided to use generics since it is used pretty extensively throughout the code anyway, so I changed basically all the equals methods.

example:
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if(o instanceof Structure)
            return equals((Structure)o);
        return false;
    }

changed to:
    public boolean equals(Structure s2) {
        return name.equals(s2.getName());
    }
