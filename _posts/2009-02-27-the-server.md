My cute little server Defiant, where I run my webserver, database and trekwar server tests, deserves some recognition:

The server itself is a little aopen cube shuttle pc running fedora linux :)

The server is of course covered with Star Trek ships, a Robotech VF-1, oldschool Batman and a badger for good luck. The server is starting to get old 4-5 years, and if it where not for backups, I would frequently worry about hard drive failure. Before that happens, I hope it will reach the 1000 day uptime :)
