I think I’m in a German TV commercial for Fedcon 2011, a Sci-fi convention I’m going to in a month (It’s going to be awesome) :)

Someone recognized me in the video and was kind enough to send me an email (Thanks to Dietrich, which I met at fedcon 2009, he makes all sorts of really cool replicas) I was almost tempted to steal his Grays sports almanac, but I’m no Biff Tannen so instead I got myself 2 magnets for my kitchen (“Main Fridge”, and “Deep Freeze 9″) :D

And without further ado, here I am at 00:16 with Admiral Adama and Colonel Tigh:

Really looking forward to going to Düsseldorf this easter :)
