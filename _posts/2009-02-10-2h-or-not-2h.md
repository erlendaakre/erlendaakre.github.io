I decided to add Deuterium as a resource in Trekwar, it can be collected from nebulas or by owning star systems that have gas giants in them. Ships also now need deuterium to move, and can run out of gas if you donâ€™t plan your logistics.

Deuterium and maintenance has been added to the menu bar, and fuel to the temporary fleet box
