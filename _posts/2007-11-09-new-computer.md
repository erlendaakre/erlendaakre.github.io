I used my shiny new credit card to order myself a brand new computer today :) Just ordered the computer, will keep my old screen/keyboard mouse.

###Specs:
* Cooler Master Centurion 534 tower
* Corsair Powersupply 620W
* Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard
* AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ 3.0GHz CPU
* Corsair TWIN2X 6400 DDR2, 2GB RAM
* Samsung SpinPoint T166 500GB hard drive
* 2x XFX GeForce 8800GTS 500M 320MB graphics card
* And a new DVD Burner + a fancy mousepad


Now I can look forward to playing games such as:
* Crysis
* Farcry 2
* Silent Hunter 4 (this was so choppy on my current computer that I could not play it)
* NeverWinter Nights 2 (my computer had a really hard time running it, choppy even at low graphics)
* Call of Duty 4
* BioShock (maybe, don’t think it’s my cup of tea, at least I should play the demo)
* Half Life 2 (never really got to try this game)
* Oblivion (have not completed it yet :( and there is also the expansion)
* Age of Conan (Just going to try it a little, can probably quit any time I want)
* Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway
* Fallout 3
* GTA 4
* Postal 3
* Startrek Online
* Anything else that pops up :)
