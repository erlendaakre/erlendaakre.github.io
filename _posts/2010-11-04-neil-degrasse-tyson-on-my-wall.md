I finally got around to hanging the picture I made of Neil Degrasse Tyson on my wall today, I finished it over a month ago and now it’s finally up there for the whole world to enjoy (well, at least anyone who might happen to visit my apartment).

Now I can do all of my work under his watchful eye :D

The picture took about 10 hours to do, it is 45x45cm and made from 8100 small plastic beads (perler).
