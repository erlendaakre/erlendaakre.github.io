Yay, tomorrow Star Trek Online goes into open beta!

I’ve played around a bit in the closed beta, and so far I’m impressed, the space combat is fun and action packed, and the Ground combat is a bit like World of Warcraft, only more action, more interesting quests (no grinding, while waiting for drops) and the Fleet actions (Large open instances) were pretty awesome :)

I’ll miss my Andorian captain, who was wiped with all the other closed beta characters today :(
