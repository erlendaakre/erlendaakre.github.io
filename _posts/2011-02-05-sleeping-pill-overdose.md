Today was the international [10:23 Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10:23_Campaign). Thousands of people with a bias towards reality took huge overdoses of Homeopathic “Medicine”.

I took around 70 (3500% overdose) homeopathetic sleeping pills today, if I had taken real sleeping medicine I would probably be dead or dying about now.

Homeopathy of course is pure and utter bullshit, the 70 pills did not make me sleepy or affect me in any way, which is exactly what is expected for a “medicine” which has no active ingredients and consequently fail to show any effect besides placebo when scientifically tested.

Letting 60 pills melt under your tongue at once kinda sucks btw...
