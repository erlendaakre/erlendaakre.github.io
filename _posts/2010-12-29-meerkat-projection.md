To my great dismay searching for “Meerkat projection” always ends in disappointment:

I’ve always thought of meerkats whenever [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) comes up, so I just had to do this to get it out of my head:

PS: This computer does not have photoshop, and my GIMP skills sucks, so only the northern pole is EMBIGGIFIED (yes, it’s a word).

PPS: That image reminds me of the Star Trek TOS pilot, “The Cage”.. BOW BEFORE YOUR MEERKAT OVERLORDS!
