I’ve been watching lots of Babylon 5 lately, and just realized that a recurring part of Minbari philosophy could be seen as an homage to one of my greatest idols, Carl Sagan. And seeing it’s almost November 9th, which would have been his 75th birthday, I think a post is in order.

The Minbari in Babylon 5 believes all life are manifested as a way for the universe to examine every piece of itself. This reminds me of two quotes from Carl:

*“We are a way for the universe to know itself”*

*“We are made of star stuff”*

And why not throw in a few more great quotes (Carl is just so damned quoteable) :)

*“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.”*

*“Humans — who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals — have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain. A sharp distinction between humans and ‘animals’ is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them — without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret”*

*“We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it’s forever. “*

*“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”*

*“The major religions on the Earth contradict each other left and right. You can’t all be correct”*

*“For the first time, we have the power to decide the fate of our planet and ourselves. This is a time of great danger, but our species is young, and curious, and brave. It shows much promise.”*

*“We wish to pursue the truth no matter where it leads. But to find the truth, we need imagination and skepticism both.”*

*“I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking.”*

*“In the vastness of the Cosmos there must be other civilizations far older and more advanced than ours.”*

*“I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudo-science and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive”*

*“Credulity kills”*
