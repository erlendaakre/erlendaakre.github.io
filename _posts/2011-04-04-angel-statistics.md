Now, for a post dedicated to two of my favorite things... Angel and statistics:

I’ve got all my DVDs registered on my computer, and each time I watch a movie or an episode I give it my personal rating on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being best).

So without further ado I give you the statistics for Joss Whedon’s Angel:

First, the average rating for each season (as you can see season 2 and 4 are both awesome)
