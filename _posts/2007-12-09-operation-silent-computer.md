Everything comes at a price. For example, my new computer though being able to run Crysis pretty smooth, sounds like a small hovercraft. And I've decided to move the computer out into the hallway.

**Step 1:** Drill a large hole in the wall between the living room and the hallway, the hole is up under the roof, next to the projector screen

**Step 2:** Order one 10 meter long DVI cable, 2 PS2 cables, 3x audio cables and wait around 2 weeks :(

**Step 3:** Extend the hole to so that the DVI connector fits trough it :)

**Step 4:** Put a junction box over the hole and run all the cables trough it

**Step 5:** Put the PC in the hallway on top of your weapon safe and connect all the cables, then close up the junction boxes

**Step 6:** Enjoy your very tidy desk (that shuttle computer on my desk is my trusty server hosting aakretech.org, etc..)
