Two days ago something **wonderful** happened:

These old, horribly dark, depressing, winter aerial photos of Trondheim got replaced by new high resolution summer-time ones :)

##### Before

##### After

Why do I care you might ask?

Because I love maps, and I spend an unhealthy amount of time at Google maps =)

Google also finally got street view coverage to Tiller (the souther part of Trondheim where I live). I can even see my motorcycle parked outside:
