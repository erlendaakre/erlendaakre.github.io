Pinky was away with Anne and Erik this week, at the RoseIldern ferret show in Molde. She was gone in what seemed like forever (49,5 hours), and we are really glad to have her back :)

She came back with two prices (Second place in her category, and BEST albino/white in the entire show with around 200 ferrets)

She also won some swag (a nice glass thropy for best albino, kibbles, toys and hammocks)
